    <p>
      Hello! I'm Daisy Huang, originally from China, born in 1993. At the age of
      18, I embarked on a solo journey to the United States to pursue my passion
      for Computer Science. Growing up with two hardworking, loving parents and
      two older sisters, I learned the value of perseverance and dedication.
      <br />
      <br />
      After graduating in 2015, I dove headfirst into the tech industry, where
      I've gained invaluable experience as a software engineer. My career has
      taken me through various sectors including finTech, EdTech, AdTech, real
      estate tech, and healthcare tech. I've honed my skills in testing
      automation, devops, and backend development, and currently thrive as a
      fullstack engineer with a strong focus on backend systems.
      <br />
      <br />
      Beyond technology, I'm deeply interested in real estate investment, home
      improvement projects, and personal wellness. When I'm not immersed in
      work, you'll find me at the gym, pounding the pavement on a run, or at
      home tackling DIY projects.
      <br />
      <br />I lead an active lifestyle fueled by a passion for constant learning
      and self-improvement. With a steadfast belief that with enough dedication
      and resources, any goal is achievable, I'm always eager to tackle new
      challenges head-on
